The loader will only accept text that is in between quotation marks so any
text outside of it are treated as comments. However, each entry must be laid
out in a specific order as shown in this sample.


"EXE Test"	Title of game (63 characters max)
"\TEST1.EXE"	Path to EXE file (31 characters max)
"801FFFF0"		Stack address (from the game's SYSTEM.CNF file)
"HitMod Test 1"	"\TEST1.HIT"	"FFFFFF01"
"Stop Music"	"STOP"	"FFFFFF00"
"HitMod Test 2"	"\MUSIC.HIT"	"FFFFFF01"
€ <- End of file character (entered by typing Alt+0128).
     Everything after this character is completely ignored.

Stack addresses with specific values are used to load music file formats.
FFFFFFXX is the base "address", and XX is the type of file.
00 = Stop playing music.
01 = HITMOD mod file converted with modconv.


You can also stack the entries as a single lines like this:

"A PlayStation Game"	"\GAMEDIR\GAME.EXE"	"801FFFF0"
"A PlayStation Game 2"	"\GAMEDIR2\GAME.EXE"	"801FFFF0"

...and it looks nicer too.
